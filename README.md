# Classic Camera
This modification brings back the classic camera that had been used until 0.11.6.
- Moves the camera closer to the ship.
- Fixes the camera height.
- Removes the pitch influence on height so that looking up/down won't affect the camera height.,

**Important**: The mod best reproduces the previous camera with the settings of camera height to 0 and FoV to 50. You can check them in the game menu.

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive and you should get `PnFMods` folders, and `PnFModsLoader.py`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/PnFModsLoader.py`, etc.
4. Done!
